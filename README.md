# Game Library API

## Important

Upon reading the assignment, I misunderstood the instruction "API Subject is established" and thought it meant that I should use the same subject as in the first exam attempt. As a result, my API has a different subject than intended. Unfortunately, I realized this mistake too late to make changes. My apologies.

## Purpose

This project is an API written in JavaScript, designed for users to manage their game library. Users can add games to their library and view the games they've added.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EHB-MCT/portfolio-tweede-zit-v2-StephanVanHemelrijck.git
   cd portfolio-tweede-zit-v2-StephanVanHemelrijck
   ```

2. **Choose your environment:**

   The project supports different environments: development, production, and test. Depending on which environment you want to use, you need to copy the appropriate `.env` file:

   - For development:

     ```bash
     cp .env.development.template .env.development
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
     ```

   - For production:

     ```bash
     cp .env.production.template .env.production
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
     ```

   - For testing:

     ```bash
     cp .env.test.template .env.test
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
     ```

   We recommend for you to be prepared to use both `development` as `test` environments, since the `test` environment will run all your unit and integration tests. Whilest `development` environment will build your application and make your API accessible.

3. **Running the project:**

   Start the project by running the Docker Compose command appropriate to your chosen environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

   Replace `docker-compose.dev.yml` with the correct file for production or test environments if needed.
